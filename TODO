burrito todo:
    - fix double poll on initial location pull due to ms == 0 (line 178)
        need to set initial to 0 when state == Unknown, but interval should
        never be 0, so ScheduleOnInterval(foo, 0, NOT_ZERO)
    - state poll interval needs to be higher than location poll interval
        at all times.
    - cancel location polling when arrived state is detected
